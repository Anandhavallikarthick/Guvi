        Deployment GUVI GPT Model using Hugging Face


DOMAIN: AIOPS

Problem Statement:
The task is to deploy a fine-tuned GPT model, trained specifically on GUVI’s company data, using
Hugging Face services. Students are required to create a scalable and secure web application
using Streamlit or Gradio, making the model accessible to users over the internet. The deployment
should leverage Hugging Face spaces resources and any database to store the username and
login time.
Objective:
To deploy a pre-trained or Fine tuned GPT model using HUGGING FACE SPACES, making it
accessible through a web application built with Streamlit or Gradio.

Business Use Cases:
1.Customer Support Automation:
• Scenario: Integrate the fine-tuned GPT model with GUVI’s customer support
system to automate responses to frequently asked questions, reducing the workload on
support staff and improving response times.
• Application: The model can handle initial customer inquiries, provide information
on courses, pricing, and enrollment procedures, and escalate complex issues to human
agents when necessary.
2.Content Generation for Marketing:
• Scenario: Use the model to generate marketing content, such as blog posts, social
media updates, and email newsletters, tailored specifically to GUVI’s audience.
• Application: The marketing team can input topics or keywords into the web
application, and the model will generate relevant, high-quality content that can be edited
and published.
3.Educational Assistance for Students:
• Scenario: Implement the model as a virtual teaching assistant within GUVI’s
educational platform to help students with their queries and provide explanations on
various topics.
• Application: Students can interact with the virtual assistant through the web
application to get immediate answers to their questions, clarifications on course
material, and personalized study recommendations.

Project Workflow:
  The following is a fundamental outline of the project:

1) first i gatehered information of Guvi from various website,  wikipedia, chatGPT also. 
2) Then i Preprocess the Data and Tokenizing the Data before finetuning the model.
3) now, i set the particular Epoch fine tune the model with the processed Guvi text file and then save the model and the pickle file.
4) Then i testing my fine tuned model with Guvi informations.
5) I created the tables in sqlite3 database then i store the user name and user login time informations.
6) Finally, i deploy my finetuned model in Hugging face.
